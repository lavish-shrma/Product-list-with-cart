📦 Product List with Cart – From Pixels to Interactions

    “Code is not just instructions. It’s an experience we craft.”

Preview

Welcome to the codebase behind the Product List with Cart challenge from Frontend Mentor.
This repository isn't just a set of files — it's a journey from static design to dynamic interactivity, crafted with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
🧭 Challenge Summary

    A dynamic e-commerce interface where users can:

    🛒 Add/remove items from a cart

    ➕ Adjust quantities

    📦 View confirmation modals

    🔄 Reset their cart

    📱 Enjoy fully responsive layouts

    🧠 Experience subtle interactivity across hover/focus states

All while using zero frameworks, just the raw power of the DOM and logic.
🛤️ My Dev Process (A Timeline)
📂 1. File Discovery

    data.json: The heart — where all product details live

    /design: A JPG-only design challenge, so I had to "eyeball" typography, spacing, and sizing 🎯

🧱 2. HTML First: Skeleton Before Skin

    I mapped out semantic HTML blocks for layout clarity.

    Focused on accessibility, using proper button, aria, and role attributes.

🎨 3. CSS Magic

    Built with a mobile-first design, gradually layering in breakpoints.

    CSS Variables + BEM Naming = 💪 scalable styling.

⚙️ 4. JavaScript Logic

    “Every UI interaction is a state transition. Nothing more.”

    Built a cart model using vanilla JS — no libraries, just functions and memory.

    DOM updates in response to user interaction: quantity control, remove items, reset, confirm.

    Event delegation and dynamic rendering made the logic clean and fast.

🔧 Tech & Tools Used
Tool	Purpose
HTML5	Semantic structure
CSS3	Flexbox, media queries, transitions
JavaScript	UI logic & state
data.json	Product data source
VSCode + Live Server	Local dev
Git + GitHub Pages	Versioning & hosting
💡 Design Decisions

    “Every line of code either simplifies or complicates the future.”

    Used pure DOM manipulation to reinforce vanilla JS skills.

    Prioritised progressive enhancement — works well even if JavaScript fails partially.

    Built a modular, extendable cart logic that can scale to localStorage or backend easily.

🧠 Key Learnings

    📦 State is everything: A well-structured JS object can control the entire cart logic.

    📱 Mobile-first makes everything cleaner.

    🎯 Eyeballing design specs from JPGs is harder than it sounds — but it sharpens your eye.

    ✨ Micro-interactions (hover, active, modal feedback) make or break a polished UI.

🧪 What I’d Add Next

    🗃️ localStorage to persist cart on refresh

    🔍 Search and filter by product type

    🧪 Unit testing with Jest

    🌙 Dark mode toggle

    ♿ Enhanced ARIA + screen reader support
